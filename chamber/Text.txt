The home page is missing the hero image on medium and smaller screens. The hero image should cover that whole section that it's in. The weather coming in should all be dynamic through an api. It looks like only temp and windspeed are working dynamically, not the logo or description. Text on the home page could be centered vertically much better. Your discover page doesn't placeholder images for the lazy loading and all your images are the same. Your directory page is not working at all. Your join page title button didn't have any pattern attribute with regular expression. All these things not working are the big major things we learned in this course. So even though your site looks pretty nice, I can't give you a passing grade on this. +1 for contact page.
